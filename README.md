# CowPartsSegmentation
This repository contains the officiel dataset, trained models, and evaluation scripts for our cattle part segmentation framework based on a modified DeepLabV3+ architecture with ResNet backbones, ASPP, and MSAM attention. The model is designed for precision segmentation of head, body, legs, and tail regions in real-world farm scenarios.
